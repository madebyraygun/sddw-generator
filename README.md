# Stack

This stack combines [React JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and [Custom Elements v1](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements). In order to render custom elements a new property `element` was introduced to HTMLDivElement.

```tsx
<div element="custom-element" className="additional-class"></div>
```

... compiles into ...

```html
<custom-element class="additional-class"></custom-element>
```

More modifications like global data or inline event support can be added to `/assets/js/dom.ts` and `/.node/render.tsx`.
